The Story:

The story of Cinderella was 
originally a French fairy tale called Cendrillon, 
ou la petite pantoufle de verre 
(Cinderella or the little glass slipper).

It was first published in 1697 in a book written
 by Charles Perrault called Histoires ou contes du temps passé, 
 avec des moralités (Stories or Tales from Times Past, 
 with Morals).

 Interestingly, the first page of the book shows an illustration of an old woman spinning and telling stories with the words 'Contes de ma Mere l'Oye' 
 (Tales of My Mother the Goose).

This is the earliest known reference in print to 
Mother Goose and seems to indicate that the name 
was originally connected with stories, rather than 
with the rhymes and songs we know today as 
Mother Goose nursery rhymes. 

Although he was the first to publish the story, Charles Perrault didn't actually write the story of Cinderella himself.

Like the other tales in his book, the story of Cinderella was already well-known in Europe as part of an oral tradition of story telling going back 
hundreds of years

But Charles Perrault recorded the story with wit and style and his book was an immediate success.

It was quickly translated into English and, of course, we know that the English-speaking world loved the stories - especially the story of Cinderella - as much as the French did.
